## Overview

Whats-AI-Assistant is an AI-powered chatbot developed as a proof of concept demo at [GPT Lab Sein√§joki](https://www.tuni.fi/en/research/gpt-lab-seinajoki) AI Research Initiative. It integrates with WhatsApp using the Neonize framework, leveraging OpenAI or local language models to generate responses based on chat history and web scraping. The assistant supports multiple languages and can summarize conversations for improved interaction quality.

## Features

- **WhatsApp Integration**: Uses Neonize to interact with WhatsApp users.
- **LLM Support**: Works with OpenAI API or local Ollama models.
- **Conversation Summarization**: Generates concise summaries of previous interactions, which is injected to the LLM as additional context.
- **Web Scraping**: Extracts and processes text from links sent in messages to be used as context for the LLM.
- **Persistent Storage**: Fetches previous conversation history and saves all conversations in an SQLite database.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/whats-ai-assistant.git
cd whats-ai-assistant

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
     ```plaintext
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
     ```

2. **Application Settings**:
   - Modify `config.py` to configure various application settings:
     - **Model Settings**: Specify the language model to use (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3 or a local Ollama model).
     - **Language Preferences**: Define the default language for the assistant's responses.
## Usage

Start the assistant with:

```bash
python main.py
```

Neonize will print you a QR code in the console to link your Whatsapp account to.
