## Overview

Whats-AI-Assistant is an AI-powered chatbot developed as a proof of concept demo at GPT Lab Sein√§joki AI Research Initiative. It integrates with WhatsApp using the Neonize framework, leveraging OpenAI or local language models to generate responses based on chat history and web scraping. The assistant supports multiple languages and can summarize conversations for improved interaction quality.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/whats-ai-assistant.git
cd whats-ai-assistant

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
     ```plaintext
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
     ```

2. **Application Settings**:
   - Modify `config.py` to configure various application settings:
     - **Model Settings**: Specify the language model to use (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3 or a local Ollama model).
     - **Database Paths**: Set the path for the SQLite database to store conversations.
     - **Language Preferences**: Define the default language for the assistant's responses.
     - **Neonize Configuration**: Configure Neonize settings to connect to your desired WhatsApp account. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Neonize documentation](https://github.com/krypton-byte/neonize).
